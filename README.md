# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation
## DH 110, Laudan Hosseini
This project is a heuristic evaluation for the apps "Audiobooks HQ" and "Starbucks". Here, we will go through all 10 heuristics and determine whether they are done effectively for each application. 

## App 1: Starbucks

| Heuristics | Comments | Severity Rating | Improvements | 
| ---------- | -------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| 01: Visibility of System Status | Bad: Doesn't update us on our order after placing it and oftentime gives the wrong time estimates on when orders will be ready. Good: Has prominent loading icons for refreshing the page or when switching to another page.  |  2 | Give more accurate estimates on updating the user on when the order is going to be ready and/or if there are delays. Maybe including a step by step update (similar to Dominos) will be a good idea. |
