# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation
## DH 110, Laudan Hosseini
This project is a heuristic evaluation for the apps "Audiobooks HQ" and "Starbucks". Here, we will go through all 10 heuristics and determine whether they are done effectively for each application. 

## App 1: Starbucks

| Heuristics | Comments | Severity Rating | 
| ---------- | -------- | --------------- | 
| 01: Visibility | Bad: Doesn't update us on our order after placing it and oftentime gives the wrong time estimates on when orders will be ready. |  2 | 
| 02: Match between system and real world | Good: Uses a lot of symbols that correspond to its meaning; for example, using coffee cup as the "order" tab, using a home for the "home" tab, using a QR code symbol as the "scan" tab. | N/A |
| 03: User control and freedom | Bad:
